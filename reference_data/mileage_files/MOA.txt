Note that a 2022 signalling plan suggests that MOA applies to the down line only.  This does not correlate with mapping evidence that shows a significant deviation from ABD, particularly at the low mileage end, to the up (northbound) side of the line.  The Sectional Appendix to the Working Timetable applies to both lines.
